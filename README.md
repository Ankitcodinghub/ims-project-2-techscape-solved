1 Introduction

Welcome to TechScape. In the beginning of 2020, five Portuguese entrepreneurs built a startup to sell goods related to digital detox. Using an online store, TechScape sells products and services which will allow their customers to stay focused on the most important things and improve the balance with technology use in their lives, such as meditation kits, books, stress balls, ‚Äùdumb‚Äù phones, retreats, among others.

With the emergence of Covid-19 in March 2020, the company had some financial difficulties, and they were out of function in April 2020. But in May 2020, they restarted their activities, knowing that a digital detox is becoming even more critical in this period of time, where people need to unplug themselves and improve their quality of life.

Focused in increasing their sales, TechScape hired a team of data scientists to analyze the online behavior of their customers and to predict which customers have a high probability of buying their products depending on their online actions.

2 Objective of the project

Your goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question ‚ÄúWhich customers are more likely to buy our products?‚Äù using the small quantity of data accessible from the customers data base that contains general information about the customers and their behaviour in the website from February 2020 till December 2020 (excluding April).

3 Datasets

You have access to two different datasets:

<div class="column">
<ol>
<li>The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. In this set, you also have the ground truth associated with each user access, i.e., if the user buy at least one product (1) or not (0).</li>
<li>The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. In this set you don‚Äôt have access to the ground truth, and the goal of your team is to predict that value (‚Äú0‚Äù or ‚Äú1‚Äù) by using the model you created using the training set.</li>
</ol>

4 Deliverables

<ol>
<li>A Jupiter notebook with all the needed code implemented to obtain the results presented in the report and to obtain the performance obtained in Kaggle. The file naming format should be ‚Äù202122 Fall AA GroupXX Notebook.ipynb‚Äù, where ‚ÄùGroupXX‚Äù should be your group number.</li>
<li>A report that describes the analytical processes and the conclusions obtained, with at most 8 pages:
‚Ä¢ Heading 1: Arial, Size 12 pt, in bold

‚Ä¢ Heading 2 (if needed): Arial, Size 11 pt, in bold and italic

‚Ä¢ Text: Arial, Size 10 pt, line space of 1.5 points.

‚Ä¢ Margins: The default ones in word (Top, Bottom, Left and Right as 1‚Äù).

All the figures and tables should be included in the Annexes (at the end of the document) and are not included on those 8 pages mentioned previously.

The file naming format should be ‚Äù202122 Fall AA GroupXX Report.pdf‚Äù, where ‚ÄùGroupXX‚Äù should be your group number.
</li>
</ol>
4.1 Notes

<ul>
<li>We will evaluate all the topics mentioned based on the report ‚Äì a well-structured and succinct report will have a big weight on the evaluation.</li>
<li>The jupyter notebook will be analyzed only if some doubt arises during the report evaluation. If some steps were done in the Jupyter notebook but not described in the report, we will not evaluate those. As an example, imagine you check the outliers, and at the end of your project, you decide to keep them.

In the report, you should mention how you check if you had outliers, what the steps were to remove them and why you decide to keep them at the end, among other insights that can be relevant. The jupyter notebook should be delivered with all the cells already run.

‚Ä¢ The report and the code will pass through a process of plagiarism checking.

‚Ä¢ For more information, please read the Kaggle competition rules care- fully.

A project that focus only on the techniques and methodologies

the practical classes will have at most 17 values. The remaining 3 values are possible to achieve if contributions based on self-study and creativity are applied, and clearly explained on the report.

This bullet-list provides some details about each aspect:

‚Ä¢ Kaggle performace: The performance obtained on Kaggle, on the submission selected (F1 Score).

‚Ä¢ Report-quality: Each report should describe the steps and main insights along the process. Clarity, synthesis, objectiveness, and business-contextualization are very welcome;
